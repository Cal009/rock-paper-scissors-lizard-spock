# My Rock Paper Scissors lizard Spock!

Rock Paper Scissors is a well known game played around the world due to its simple but addictive nature. Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, takes what is great about the orignal game and enhances it with more chances to out play your opponent. The object of the game is to beat the opponent by selecting one of the 5 choices, hoping the opponent chooses one you can beat. The rules of the game are further explained in the footer of my website to avoid any confusion when playing.
